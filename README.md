# Arduino Micro Payloads ⚡🖥️

This repository contains a collection of **Arduino Micro (ATmega32U4) HID payloads**.  
These payloads demonstrate how an Arduino Micro can act like a **USB Rubber Ducky**,  
performing automated keystroke injection for **education, research, and ethical security testing**.
